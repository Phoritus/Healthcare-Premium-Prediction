# 🏥 Healthcare Premium Prediction

This project is a Streamlit web application designed to predict healthcare insurance premiums based on personal, financial, and health details. The application uses machine learning models—one for young adults (≤25 years) and one for adults (>25 years)—to estimate premiums and applies an explicit insurance plan multiplier to adjust the predicted price accordingly.

## ✨ Features

### 🎯 **Premium Prediction**
- Utilizes age-specific ML models for estimating insurance premiums.
- Applies an explicit insurance plan multiplier (e.g. Bronze, Silver, Gold) to adjust the final premium.
- Confidence scoring along with fallback calculations if the ML model fails.
  
### 💱 **Currency Conversion**
- **Income Input**: THB is converted to Lakhs INR (1 Lakh INR = ฿37,900).
- **Premium Display**: Final predictions in INR are converted to THB (₹1 INR = ฿0.3804) for display.

### 🏥 **Health Assessment**
- Calculates a comprehensive risk score based on age, BMI, smoking status, medical history, and genetic factors.
- Provides personalized health recommendations and categorizes health status (Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor).

### 📊 **Interactive Visualizations**
- Real-time charts for BMI and income distributions with user highlighting.
- Detailed premium breakdown analysis comparing base plan costs with the predicted premium.

### 🎨 **User Interface**
- Responsive sidebar input forms.
- Gradient profile summary cards with color-coded health indicators.
- Seamless integration between data input, model prediction, and visualization.

## 🔄 Application Workflow

1. **Input Collection**: Users enter personal, financial, and health details via the sidebar.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Application converts income from THB to Lakhs INR, scales features, and prepares input for prediction.
3. **ML Prediction**: Depending on the age group, either the young adult or adult model is used. An insurance plan multiplier (e.g., Bronze = 1.0, Silver = 1.15, Gold = 1.30) is applied to adjust the predicted premium.
4. **Results Display**: Outputs include the predicted annual and monthly premiums (in THB), along with a detailed premium analysis.
5. **Visualization**: Interactive charts display the prediction context and health evaluation.

## 💻 Code Structure and Functions

### Main Application Functions
```python
def convert_inr_to_thb(inr_amount):

    return inr_amount * 0.3804
```

### Data Processing Functions
```python
def preprocess_input(data):
    """Prepare user input for ML prediction, including scaling and encoding"""
    # Includes currency conversion and feature scaling
```

### ML Prediction Flow

# 2. Select the model based on age
# 3. Predict premium in INR and apply insurance plan multiplier
# 4. Convert the final prediction to THB and return the result
```
